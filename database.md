- **Column**: Represents a different attributes (ID, name, age....)
- **Row**:    Respresents a different entry in the table (111, rasrivas, 50...; 222, ram, 65...;)

- **Unique Contraints**:
  - A UNIQUE contraint can be applied to any column to make sure every record has a unique value for that column.
  - For example: if we apply for **Unique Contraints** for the `Name` column then the duplicate name (with the same name) will not be allowed
